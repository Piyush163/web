    CSS3 is an updated and improved version of CSS2, with many new features and improvements. Some of the key differences between CSS2 and CSS3 are:<br><br>

Selectors: CSS3 has introduced many new selectors that allow for more specific targeting of HTML elements, including attribute selectors, structural pseudo-classes, and negation pseudo-class.<br><br>
Box model: CSS3 includes several new properties that allow for more precise control of the box model, including border-radius, box-shadow, and box-sizing.<br><br>
Typography: CSS3 has added several new properties to control typography, including font-face, text-shadow, and text-overflow.<br><br>
Layout: CSS3 has introduced new layout modules, such as Flexbox and Grid, which allow for more flexible and responsive layouts.<br><br>
Animations and transitions: CSS3 includes new properties for creating animations and transitions, such as animation, transition, and transform.<br><br>
Media queries: CSS3 includes media queries, which allow for more flexible and responsive designs based on the size and orientation of the viewport.<br><br>
Overall, CSS3 offers more powerful and flexible tools for web developers, allowing for more creative and engaging designs. However, not all web browsers fully support all CSS3 features, so developers may need to use fallbacks or alternative solutions for older browsers.<br><br>
